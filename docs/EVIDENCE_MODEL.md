# Evidence Model

Puzzle Genome Atlas has one claim-assessment scheme and three narrow
record/workflow fields. They answer different questions and must not substitute
for one another.

| Scope | Fields | Allowed values | Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| Substantive claim | Claim status + evidence quality + confidence | Defined below | What is claimed, how it is supported and how likely it is to change |
| Gene record | Lifecycle | `Active`, `Deprecated`, `Merged`, `Split` | May this stable gene ID be used? |
| Game analysis | Analysis status | `draft`, `reviewed` | Has the record completed review? |
| Taxonomy proposal | Proposal status | `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Superseded` | What decision was made about the proposal? |

Terms such as “baseline”, “novelty not assessed” and “next research subject”
are descriptive roles or conclusions, not additional status systems.
Candidate terms have no stable ID and are not gene records, so `Candidate` is
not a gene lifecycle value.

Every substantive claim must expose three independent fields:

1. claim status;
2. evidence quality;
3. confidence.

The old single ladder mixed different questions. A hypothesis is a kind of
claim, while corroboration is a property of its evidence. Keeping them separate
prevents a sourced fact about one game from being mistaken for a cross-family
pattern.

## Claim status

### Observation

A directly recorded fact about one artefact, game, source, event or experiment.

Examples:

- behaviour reproduced from source code;
- a transition observed through direct play;
- a dated statement by a game's creator.

### Hypothesis

A falsifiable proposed explanation, relationship or prediction that has not met
the threshold for a pattern.

Every hypothesis must state what evidence could weaken or reject it.

### Pattern

A recurring, scoped relationship supported by at least two independent relevant
observations. Two close clones do not normally count as independent families.

Known counterexamples and the claimed scope must be stated.

### Strong Pattern

A pattern reproduced across at least three mechanically distinct puzzle
families, supported by sources and tested against plausible counterexamples.

The numeric threshold is a minimum review trigger, not automatic promotion.

### Confirmed

A bounded claim independently verified within its stated scope. This status is
appropriate for exact rules or historical facts with direct and corroborating
evidence.

`Confirmed` does not mean universal. Cross-family generalisations normally
remain `Pattern` or `Strong Pattern`.

## Evidence quality

- `Direct` — primary artefact, source code, official rules or reproduced test.
- `Corroborated` — supported by multiple independent sources or methods.
- `Limited` — relevant evidence exists but is narrow, indirect or incomplete.
- `Conflicting` — credible sources or observations disagree.

## Confidence

- `High` — unlikely to change without new contradictory evidence.
- `Medium` — useful but materially uncertain.
- `Low` — preliminary, weakly supported or sensitive to assumptions.

Confidence never promotes claim status by itself.

## Required notation

Short claims may use:

`[Status | Evidence quality | Confidence]`

Long analyses may define a claim ledger with stable local IDs and let sections
inherit those labels. Any exception must be explicit; unlabelled generalisations
are not acceptable.

Lifecycle and workflow status never replace these three fields. An `Active`
gene can still be supported by an `Observation`; a `reviewed` analysis can
contain low-confidence hypotheses.

## Promotion and downgrade

- `Observation → Confirmed` requires independent verification of the bounded
  claim.
- `Hypothesis → Pattern` requires repeated independent observations.
- `Pattern → Strong Pattern` requires cross-family replication and an explicit
  counterexample search.
- Any status may be downgraded when evidence conflicts or scope was overstated.

Puzzle Genome Atlas does not use `Law`. No current evidence justifies a universal
law of puzzle mechanics, and no contributor or agent may introduce the status
without a separate governance decision.
